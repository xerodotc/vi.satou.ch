## Introduction

My name is Visatouch. Also use "xerodotc" as an alias on the internet.
I'm a software engineer working at some private sector company 
(take a look at my CV if you what to know where I'm working).

I have interests and passions for innovations and technologies that will impact everyday life
and improve our standard of living. Stand for people's freedom, liberty and democracy. Against any form of authoritarianism.

I like Japanese pop cultures (i.e. anime, manga, music, games, seiyuus, and concerts).
BanG Dream! is my personal favorite series, and I would describe myself as BanGDreamer (BanG Dream! fan).
