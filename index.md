## Introduction

My name is Visatouch Deeying. My nickname is Boat.
Also use "xerodotc" or "Shiro Doushi" as an alias on the internet.

I have interest in creations and technologies that will impact how we live.
(e.g. Internet of things, smart city and automation)

I think I can be described as otaku. I like anime, manga and games.
