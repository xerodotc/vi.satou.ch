## Introduction

My name is Visatouch Deeying. My nickname is Boat.
Also use "xerodotc" as an alias on the internet.

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering at Chulalongkorn University.
My current research topic is about vehicular networks.
I have interest in creations and technologies that will impact how we live. (e.g. IoT and automation)

I think I can be described as otaku. I like anime, manga and games.
If the anime is involved with programming or IT/game companies (such as NEW GAME!),
I would watch it without hesitation.
